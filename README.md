## Story

The year is 2127, humans have made their first steps into galactic travel and have gone to visit a new planet capable of supporting life - *Elir*. 

A large group of scientists had been sent to the planet to examine the atmosphere and its conditions. Strange sitings had been reported throughout their mission. At first mysterious sitings of unexplainable animals, then bones, larger than anything that had been anticipated. Lastly there was a report of an underground installation with an active power source. This was the last transmission received from the team.

A recon and rescue mission has now been planned to save any scientists that our found and to see what has happened. Having assembled the only 4 marines in near-orbit, it is time.

Good luck.
